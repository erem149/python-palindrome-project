# Math Tutor - Project
# Multiplication tables
# Object: Create application to practice multiplication tables
# User specifies number of random pratice questions
# User is presented with a prompt e.g. 5 X 5 = and inputs the answer for each of the questions.
# When all questions are answered : printout following info
# a. Some form of 'thanks for playing greeting'
# b. Number of correct answers/total answers
# c. % correct
# use different rows as you wish.
# Remember \n (line break) or "doesn't work properly with Brython"
# Bonus 1: also measure/present the time it took to answer questions: in total and per question
# Bonus 2: let user specify how high the numbers used should be
# Bonus 3: show all questions and answers at end

# ask how many questions user wants

for a in answer_list:
    print(a)
# create two random numbers and calc answer
# show user the question
# capture answer and modify user score
# output final score
